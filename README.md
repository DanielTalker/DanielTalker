This project mirrors the complex interactions of a social media platform, offering features such as user profiles, friend systems, posts, comments, and real-time updates. Designed to showcase my full-stack development skills, Foobar provides a deep dive into the practical applications of technologies like React, Node.js, and MongoDB.                                             
The complete project will soon be accessible for browsing on my GitHub repository.
